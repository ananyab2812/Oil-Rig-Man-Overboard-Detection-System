# Oil-Rig-Man-Overboard-Detection-System
Real-time Man Overboard (MOB) Detection for offshore platforms. Uses YOLOv10 and OpenCV for person tracking. Critical Safety Feature: Employs temporal persistence (deque logic) to maintain the "MAN OVERBOARD" alert and last known coordinates for 10 frames after the person is out of sight, maximizing rescue response time.

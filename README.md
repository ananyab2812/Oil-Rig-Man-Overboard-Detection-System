This project details the development of an Automated Man Overboard (MOB) Detection and Tracking System specifically designed for deployment on oil rigs or other maritime platforms. Accidental falls from height or into the sea pose a significant and critical risk in these environments. Traditional surveillance methods rely on constant human monitoring, which is susceptible to fatigue and error, especially in poor visibility or during long shifts. This system leverages advanced Computer Vision and Deep Learning techniques to provide a real-time, persistent, and automated solution for identifying and tracking a person who has fallen into the water or is at risk.
The core of the system is the YOLOv10 object detection model, which processes live video feeds to identify human figures. Crucially, the system incorporates a temporal persistence mechanism using a fixed-length queue (deque) to maintain an alert state for a specified duration (FRAME_HISTORY) even after the person is no longer visible in the current frame. This ensures that a critical warning is not lost due to momentary occlusions or the person sinking out of sight immediately.
